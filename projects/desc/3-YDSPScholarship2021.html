    In 2020, I was informed of the opportunity to apply for the Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP) Scholarship. After passing an 
    internal round of interviews, I was shortlisted by DSTA for an interview.

    In the preparation for the interview, I had the opportunity to discover more about Singapore's defences, particularly in the technological
    front, while guided by one of my teachers. I explored more <strong>cybersecurity concepts</strong> and how they might be important in 
    Singapore, and better understood my own passion for this field.

    It was an honour to be conferred the scholarship in 2021, and it gave me access to much more opportunities to further enrich my learning 
    about different topics in defence science. It has helped to <strong>fuel my motivation</strong> to actively learn more to help contribute to 
    Singapore's defence science. I also gained a much better <strong>appreciation</strong> of all the work that goes into keeping Singapore safe, 
    especially in the digital world that we may begin to take for granted.
