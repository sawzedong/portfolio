    In 2021, the theme for the Splash Awards challenge was <strong>"How will Digital Intelligence & Cloud transform Singapore in a 
    Post-Pandemic World?</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
    My team had noticed the increasing trend of <strong>online shopping</strong> due to COVID-19, and the related <strong>scams</strong> that 
    arised, and decided on developing a website that had scam protection methods built in. Through the use of AI, listings were scanned for 
    malicious activity and appropriate action was taken to warn buyers and restrict sellers. In the end, we were awarded a special award 
    for <strong>Winner of Cybersecurity Theme.</strong>

    Through this competition, I had the chance to better understand the various applications of AI in helping to improve people's lives.
    Through developing my own solution, I was also made aware of the <strong>importance of scam prevention,</strong> and how to effectively 
    deter people from falling for such scams, such as through repeated warnings for the buyers. The ability to bring my <strong>idea 
    into fruition</strong> in a prototype with reviews from friends also helped me understand areas for improvement, developing me further 
    in my aim to help keep others safe online.
