            <p data-aos="fade">
                I am currently a student at Dunman High School, who discovered programming at the age of 11. After playing around with 
                some of the code, I came to light my passion for computer software and programming, and have been avidly coding since 
                then.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">
                Having been in my school's Infocomm Club, I have also had many learning experiences and journeys. This has allowed me to 
                develop a strong passion in this field. There is still much more for me to discover, and I will continue to stay open-minded 
                to all the various opportunities that may be presented to me, participating actively in such learning experiences.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">
                Apart from that, my experiences in my projects have helped to build up my critical-thinking, teamwork and communication skills. 
                However, I do believe that my leadership sills as well as creativity are soft skills that I intend to further develop myself 
                in.
            </p>
