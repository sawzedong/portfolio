    In 2019, participants of Singapore Games Creation Competition (SGCC) were tasked to come up with a game following the theme of 
    <strong>Living Happily, Healthily and Wisely</strong>.

    My team developed a <strong>'life-simulation game'</strong> in Scratch, and as the player ages, they could participate in various 
    activities corresponding to the aspects of life (such as studying or working). This included a few minigames in the game.

    However, due to time constraints, although the game's main idea was completed, it was not very polished, and did not achieve any
    awards.

    This was one of my very first experiences with game development. I gained many insights about <strong>game design, game art, and actual 
    programming.</strong> I better understood game concepts to making my game interesting and fun to play (such as by coming up with a 
    overarching design and story theme). This was a very fruitful experience for my first complete game.
