    In 2022, I took part in the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympaid (SJChO) and Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO).

    Both these competitions required not only an understanding of content at a level higher than others, but also placed strong emphasis on 
    the <strong>applications of these concepts into the questions' contexts.</strong> For SJChO, it took the form of 2 rounds, one theory and 
    one practical. SJPO had the individual and team rounds.

    In the end, through the guidance from my teachers, I was able to attain a gold award for SJChO, and a silver award for the SJPO individual 
    round and bronze for SJPO team round.

    These olympiads have not only been very helpful in giving me a taster for the subject in the A-level standard through the introduction of 
    new concepts, but have also trained my critical thinking skills in application of these concepts. Especially in the SJPO team round, the 
    questions often involved formulae from multiple different topics and hence required a <strong>keen eye to discern</strong> what would be 
    the appropriate steps to solve the problems. This skill of <strong>applying my own content knowledge to real-world scenarios</strong> as 
    posed by the olympiads would be especially important in my future career and other projects.
