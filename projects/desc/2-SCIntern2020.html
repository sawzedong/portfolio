    The Student Council's (SC) main objective is to plan initiatives, events and other projects for the school to <strong>better student 
    lives</strong>. In 2020, after being selected to take part in SC internship, I selected the <strong>orientation project</strong> to welcome 
    the students that were newly entering Dunman High School.

    Through the planning process, we had a large number of meetings to <strong>coordinate games and produce videos</strong>. Although the 
    process was long, and there were many times I had to fork out my own time to take part in this, I still found the experience 
    <strong>very rewarding</strong> when looking at the smile on the faces of the new students after orientation.

    In 2021, in order to have more time pursuing other passions, I opted to not continue serving in SC. However, the time that I was able 
    to help <strong>give back to the school</strong> and to be in SC was a very fruitful experience. I learnt many <strong>leadership traits 
    and qualities</strong> through sharing sessions and also interactions with my seniors. Overall, it had greatly honed my ability as a leader 
    and to learn more about how to take care of not only the work aspect of leadership, but to <strong>understand and connect with my 
    teammates</strong> better in projects.
