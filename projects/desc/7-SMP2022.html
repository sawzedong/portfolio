    Science Mentorship Programme (SMP) is a research programme whereby I was able to work in a group of 3, select a research topic and carry 
    out experiments using the equipment provided in school laboratories. I was able to carry out research on the topic of 
    <strong>fusion of various strains of mushrooms for medical and environmental purposes</strong>.

    Through the process, we faced many setbacks. For example, the fusion process had to be <strong>repeated</strong> multiple times. However, 
    with each iteration, we were able to continually <strong>identify the issue</strong> that limited our progress, and worked hard to rectify 
    it the next round. In the end, we were able to obtain a final research report.

    SMP gave me a chance to <strong>stengthen my experimentation and practical skills</strong>, requiring me to be able to always consider all the 
    possible case scenarios to understand the failures and successes of my experiments. Furthermore, these also improved my <strong>scientific communication skills</strong>. 
    I was able to reference other existing works to gain a better knowledge of the experiments I was doing, and to communicate my findings 
    well in a research report.
