    In DSO World of Science (WOS) held in 2022, I selected the <strong>Computer Security</strong> module in order to further increase my 
    knowledge of the field of cybersecurity and its related threats. 
</p>
<p class="projdesc">
    Through the WOS module, I was exposed to a variety of types of digital security, such as <strong>web, mobile and hardware security.</strong>
    I was also able to try some hands-on with the software provided to better understand the threats in the field, such as Wireshark, binary 
    analysis software, and many more.

    Overall, this activity added much fun to my 2022 June holidays, giving me the opportunity to find out more about computer security while 
    allowing me to also <strong>interact with the given softwares.</strong> I gained a new understanding of the large range of computer security 
    aspects, which has <strong>piqued my interest</strong> in finding out more about the different types of computer security. I was also able 
    to better apply these concepts to understanding how different hackers may utilise <strong>methods to exploit vulnerabilities</strong>, and 
    the importance of safeguarding these systems.
