    Ever since Secondary 1, when I joined Infocomm Club as my CCA, I had also <strong>looked up to and felt inspired by</strong> my chairperson, 
    who often led the CCA in many lessons and activities. Hence, in 2021, when I had the opportunity, I successfully ran for the role of 
    chairperson.

    After I took on the role, I was tasked with leading my executive committee (EXCO) in <strong>planning training sessions</strong> for my 
    CCA mates, while also helping to <strong>plan any major events</strong> (such as CCA selection for Sec 1s, Open House and more). This was 
    a very fun time for me to showcase my passion in Infocomm by helping to teach others with the assistance of my friends in the EXCO.

    In my 1 year-long journey as chairperson, I was able to teach my CCA mates on topics such as Web Design and Competitive Programming, 
    planning lessons that many were interested in. Through this leadership opportunity, I was able to <strong>work very closely with my 
    teachers</strong> to help <strong>bring maximum benefit to my CCA</strong> and contribute in a meaningful way to the CCA. I was able to 
    also work with a close-knit team and we greatly enjoyed our time EXCO. After learning on the difficult concepts myself, I could 
    <strong>challenge myself</strong> to explain it in a simple manner that my juniors could also understand. This hence provided a very fun 
    time as chairperson.
