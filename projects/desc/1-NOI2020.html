    I began preparing for National Olympiad of Informatics (NOI), a competitive programming competition, in mid-2019, where I attended a C++ 
    course at the NUS School of Computing in order to improve my skills for NOI. Apart from that, I participated in CCA trainings and attempted 
    competitive programming questions online to further develop my <strong>concepts and algorithms</strong> for NOI.

    During NOI 2020, although the problems were difficult, I was still able to obtain partial scores for a few of the tasks. Overall, 
    I achieved a <strong>Bronze medal</strong> and specially given the <strong>Youngest Medallist</strong> award. Being my first NOI, 
    it was a rather proud achievement.

    NOI has truly challenged my ability to think logically and develop solutions to difficult problems that were not only <strong>
    algorithmically-correct</strong>, but also <strong>time efficient</strong>. It also honed my ability to write better code in C++ and 
    Python. There was the requirement of using complex programming concepts, and it allowed me to appreciate how programming skills alone is 
    never sufficient, but must be paired with a good grasp on how to utilise programming to achieve a certain goal.
