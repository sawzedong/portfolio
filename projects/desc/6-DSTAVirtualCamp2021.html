    In 2021, the theme of the DSTA Virtual Science and Technology Camp was <strong>"Into the World of Virtual and Augmented Reality"</strong>.

    Through sharings by professors as well as dialogue sessions in certain fields, there were many opportunities to learn more about what VR/AR 
    was and its <strong>applications in the real-world context.</strong> However, the main highlight was the hackathon where we had to use 
    CoSpaces to create a simulation of VR for a real-world application. In the end, our team designed a <strong>Prototype VR game to Simulate 
    Terrorist Attacks in Singapore</strong>.

    Through the sharings, I was able to better appreciate how such new technologies, such as VR and AR, that may appear to only be useful for 
    entertainment, can have many different uses in real life. Through my research and the sharings, I began to get a view into how such novel 
    technologies like VR have many applications even in vital installations, such as in helping military training. Overall, it was a 
    <strong>fun learning experience</strong> while working with my friends on coming up with and working on a strong pitch for our idea.
